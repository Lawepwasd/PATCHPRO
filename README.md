# PATCHPRO
PatchPro: Patch Synthesis for Property Repair of Deep Neural Networks

## Requirements
### Installation
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
### Preparation
For the reproduction of the results, you need to substitute some files in the `torchattacks` package with the files in the `AutoAttack_for_AdvRepair` folder.

Specifically, for the CIFAR-10 dataset, due to the common use of `transforms.Normalize((0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465), (0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010))` for normalization during training, which shifts the pixel values out of the [0,1] range, we removed the `torch.clamp(x, 0, 1)` operation in AutoAttack. So, you should substitute some files in the `torchattacks` package with the files in the `AutoAttack_for_PatchPro` folder whose
suffix is `_cifar10.py`.

### Dataset and Models
you can download the dataset and models from [here]([http](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16XSk9CfwCnbygDfTACA_2yFmBe7vauCY?usp=drive_link)) and put it in the `data` and `models` folder respectively.
